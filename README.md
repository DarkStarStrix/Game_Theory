# Prisoner's Dilemma Simulation

## Overview
This Python-based simulation project explores the dynamics of the Prisoner's Dilemma, a fundamental concept in game theory. The project focuses on the implementation and analysis of various strategies, particularly highlighting a hybrid strategy - Self-Preservation + Tit for Tat. This innovative approach integrates the classic reciprocal strategy of Tit for Tat with elements of self-protection, aiming to provide insights into adaptive behaviors in strategic decision-making scenarios.

## Features
- Implementation of the Prisoner's Dilemma game.
- Strategies: Always Cooperate, Always Defect, Random, Self-Preservation + Tit for Tat.
- Visualization of game rounds and strategies.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Usage
Run `prisoners_dilemma.py` to execute the simulation and generate the outcome plots.
